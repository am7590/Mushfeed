They are a tropical mushroom and need a warmer temperature – something between 18 and 27 0C. If you have a warm house you may be able to grow them in winter.",

Egg trays need no further preparation (see video); but if you are using cardboard boxes you’ll want to either cut the card into similar sized squares (layer the mushroom spawn between the squares) or tear into strips.", "Once completely cool, drain as much of the water off as you can – squeeze the cardboard to remove the excess. Your media is now ready for inoculation with the spawn. Once completely cool, drain as much of the water off as you can – squeeze the cardboard to remove the excess. Your media is now ready for inoculation with the spawn.", "In this step the mushrooms are left in a warm place for a few weeks to colonise the cardboard. Close the bag up again and put it back in a warm place for 3 – 4 weeks (pink oysters) and 4 – 6 weeks (blue-grey).", "Open the outer plastic bag so that air can reach the egg trays or the bag containing the cardboard strips. The oxygen will stimulate the mushroom to fruit. After a few days, you will begin to see baby ‘pin mushrooms’ of the ‘first flush’ form. These will grow fast into full sized mushrooms in just a few days."]
