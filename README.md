Mushfeed is a niche app built specifically for gourmet mushroom lovers. It is my first large-scale personal project, and has the following features:
  * Real time photo sharing and social media features (like, comment, view profile, report/delete post, recover account)
  * Interactive mushroom index featuring information on gourmet, poisonous, non-edible, and choice mushrooms commonly found in North America/Europe
  * Grow mushrooms index with step-by-step instructions to grow edible gourmet mushrooms 

How did I make Mushfeed?
 * Senior year of High School I enrolled in a Swift Development Course and learned the basics to Swift and UIKit 
 * I enrolled in several online courses to learn about MVVM and Firebase Auth/Cloud Firestore
 * I learned SwiftUI to make my app usable and great-looking
 
 Why Mushrooms?
  * I wanted to build a niche-specific app that would be practical for those who use it
  * Mushroom enthusiasts gave the best feedback when I sent out a survey asking about which features they wanted in an app
